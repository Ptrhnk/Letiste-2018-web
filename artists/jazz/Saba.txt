Early life
Saba excelled in elementary school and skipped two grades. He began playing piano at age 7, which led to experimentation with beat making software.[3] He began high school at 12 and graduated at 16 with a 3.9 GPA.[1] He attended St. Joseph's in the Chicago suburb, Westchester.[1] Saba would pass out mixtapes in his high school hallways to get his name out there.

At age 16, Saba began performing at YouMedia Center and Young Chicago Authors (YCA) in the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago.[1] These after school open mics gave Saba the confidence and charisma he portrays on stages today.
